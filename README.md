 Made in [Godot 4.2.1](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2.1-stable/); the easiest way to play the latest version in any platform is to open the project with the Godot Engine executable!

 Since we participated in the Cádiz (Spain) site of the Jam, the game is available only in Spanish (at least for the moment), sorry!

### Synopsis:
There's nothing worse than telling a joke and seeing nobody laughing. To make things even worse, our protagonist has ADHD and struggles with just thinking! Help him remember their jokes and coordinate between the items that fall over them, or *they* will be the joke of the show!

### Controls:
 - **Left click** to choose how the jokes end
 - **WASD/Space/Arrow keys** to move the character
